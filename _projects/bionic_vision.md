Inspired by new bionic vision technologies such as [PRIMA](https://www.upmc.com/services/eye/services/retina-vitreoretinal/prima-study), I designed experiments to simulate the prosthetic implant to measure the visual acuity using a monitor setup with eye-tracking and an immersive VR environment. I compared normal visual acuity to simulated prosthetic visual acuity using four different array designs and used HTC VIVE to render visual inputs, Python and C# scripts to simulate how this input is perceived by a real patient and Unity to set-up a virtual environment.
