Wouldn't it be cool to be able to talk to agents in a VR environment? This project was aimed at enhancing the learning experiences of users through VR immersive settings in a manner that does not let the user become entirely dependent on the technology. It can be further developed for various applications such as simulating a "teacher" in VR, encouraging social experiences or language learning (to help users better speak a language without the pressure and anxiety to be perfect). 

In this project, I created such interactable agents realistic conversations using NLP APIs (DialogFlow, OpenAI) in Unity and implemented three different behaviors (angry, happy, sad) for characters using asset scripts in Unity! I built an application with the three agents in Unity and deployed it on Oculus Quest 2.
