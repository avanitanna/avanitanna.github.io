Currently, I am working with [Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html), leading AI applications for a B2C platform. I also hold a lecturer position with the Computer Science department at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) -- where I led the design of the first introductory data science course integrating LLMs using Jupyter AI and GPT models, setting a new standard for data science education at the university. Some of my previous work experiences include [Domino.ai (Domino Data Lab)](https://domino.ai/) where I built software to operate AI at scale! I have previously worked as a data scientist at the [International Committee of the Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/en) in Geneva, and at [Carlson Wagonlit Travel](https://www.mycwt.com/) in Paris. Some of my research experiences include [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), [Columbia Business School](https://business.columbia.edu/), [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) and [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). I am grateful for these diverse, international experiences that have shaped my personality - they allow me to bring a unique perspective to the table! 

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), where I focused on applications and systems and was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. William Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) and [Prof. Amr El Abbadi](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~amr/). I also hold a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I worked on Auction Theory and Game Theory and was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. D Manjunath](https://iitb.irins.org/profile/11188).  

When I am not working, I love traveling, reading books, doing sports, dancing, spending time with loved ones, and painting (occasionally)! I am a generally curious person interested in learning new things - feel free to contact me for a chat or for an interesting event!
